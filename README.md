game title: Simon Says

background:
I studied music theory and composition from the ages of 8 to 18. I grew to love complex pieces with linear melodies. The lack of rhyme or reason within a structure that needed 'some form of reason was deeply facinating. Upon my venture exploring the different game-build options, Simon Says shared a lot of these similar attributes to the complex pieces of music I poured over in my youth. Linear sequence... randomly chosen... increasing complexity with each repetion... so much fun. Especially with the notes attributed to each button.
